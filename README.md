# Unemployment-Analysis-with-Python
In this data science project, we embarked on a comprehensive analysis of the unemployment rate, a critical economic indicator, with a particular focus on the unprecedented challenges brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. Our exploratory data analysis yielded valuable insights that shed light on the dynamics of unemployment in India.

We observed a significant surge in the Estimated Unemployment Rate during the Covid-19 lockdown, underscoring the profound impact of the pandemic on the labor market.

Our state-wise analysis highlighted the states that bore the brunt of this crisis. Puducherry and Jharkhand stood out with the highest Estimated Unemployment Rates during the lockdown, while Haryana and Tripura held the top positions before the pandemic.

The transition from pre-lockdown to lockdown was marked by shifts in the states with the highest Estimated Unemployment Rates. Tripura, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh led the rankings before the lockdown, whereas Puducherry, Jharkhand, and Bihar claimed the top spots during the lockdown.

This project not only provided valuable insights into the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic but also demonstrated the power of data science in understanding and addressing complex socio-economic challenges. The findings contribute to informed decision-making and policy formulation, and underscore the importance of data-driven approaches in mitigating the effects of future crises.
